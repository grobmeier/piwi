            PIWI is an XML/XSLT Transformation Framework written in
            PHP. It's basic concepts and ideas have been stolen from
            the great Java-Applications
            <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            and
            <a href="http://forrest.apache.org" rel="nofollow">
               Apache Forrest
            </a>
            . Cocoon is still great, but very complex and of course
            in Java, which makes it not useful for people who want
            the power for their small project, but not the pain.

            PIWI runs on every standard PHP-Webhost with PHP &gt; 5
            installed.
