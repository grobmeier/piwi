      <section>PIWI is web-centric and so it supports features and helpers which are
         quite usable for creating websites.<br />
          PIWI is here to integrate different
         datasources like CMS, flat files or databases, change that
         input into PIWI-XML and then serialize it in multiple formats like HTML or PDF. 
         Currently PIWI focus is in generating XML from
         different sources and transforming it into HTML. 
         <br />
         PIWI is not a CMS. If you are looking for something which
         enables you to edit your content within an online HTML editor or
         similar, you are wrong.</section>
