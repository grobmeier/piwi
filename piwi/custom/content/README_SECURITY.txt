Dear user,

i have not tested or developed this app with an eye at
security. Therefore you should know that if you place this
folder on a path visible to every visitor, then your
passwords may be visible to them. Most passwords are unleashed
in connectors.xml.

To avoid this security risk, tell your webserver that this
folder cannot be read by "other" people with your ftp client.

After developing all necessary functions i will start with caring
about such issues and help making everything more comfortable.

Best regards,
CG
